## Here is my Bio. It is all about me and my travels
------------------------------------------------------------------

I am origanilly from the Islnad of the Dominican Repulic and I love the island life. 

Ever since I was a kid i have always wanted to travel different parts of the world.

After meeting my husband, we joined the service snd began to travel the world one place at a time.

There aren't many places I don't want to visit so that leaves many places to be seen.

If my plans work out I would like to travel countries in all areas of the world.
